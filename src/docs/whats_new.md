## Community Highlights

### It has been a while...

Kibisis has been on a bit of a sabbatical - life is full of surprises, and it tends to catch us all off-guard at some point.

However, we have picked up the torch once more and are working to support some of the brilliant community-driven projects that have been gaining traction.

We will continue to add support for these projects to provide you with the richest experience possible. ðŸ˜Š

### Voi Improvement Proposals - VIPs

Like most Layer 1 blockchains, standards and specifications begin to develop as the chain grows in popularity. It benefits all current and future builders to have these standards and specifications well documented.

We are pleased to introduce a community-driven effort to create a consolidated source for standards and specifications - focused on, but not limited to, the Voi blockchain: [Voi Improvement Proposals (VIPs)](https://vips.voi.community).

The VIP process is open to everyone who shares Voiâ€™s community-driven vision (and even those who donâ€™t ðŸ˜‰).

## Closing Words

Thank you for your continued interest in Kibisis! We hope you are enjoying using it.

It has been an epic ride so far, and we could not have got this far without you and your continued support.
