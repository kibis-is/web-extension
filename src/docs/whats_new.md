### EnVoi Naming Service

Let's be honest, AVM addresses are just not very easy to read. Us humans are just not meant to read those long capitalized jumble of letters and numbers. However, the amazing folks over at [enVoi](https://envoi.sh) have worked hard to release Voi's very own naming service!

Now you can own your very own, human-friendly, `.voi` name. This global unique identifier allows you couple your address and define your decentralized identity.

Kibisis is working closely with the enVoi team and will be providing first-class support for `.voi` names.

## Closing Words

Thank you for your continued interest in Kibisis! We hope you are enjoying using it.

It has been an epic ride so far, and we could not have got this far without you and your continued support.
